**Mind Beat Coin Plan**  
(For sweat, work, time, and life’s worth.)

### 1. **Mark's Mean More Than Gold**

- **Square**: Work sharp. Get it right. It’s worth gold.
- **Compass**: Go straight. Keep true. Make all paths clear.
- **Navel**: Feed both body and soul. Care keeps life full.
- **Knee**: Bow low. Give what you can. Serve with pride.

### 2. **Veil: The Gate of Trade**

- The **Veil** is the way. It’s the door that lets work turn to pay.  
- Each mark made is a step, tracked, linked in time, each trade is firm.

### 3. **Tokens, Growth, and Pay**

- The **Token of Priest**: Each step builds a gift.  
- Each mark on the **Veil** is worth more than sweat—it’s growth.  
- Pay grows as you rise, from step to step. Rise to the next stage, get more.

### 4. **Fellowship: Link and Grow**

- **Foot to foot**: Start the bond.  
- **Knee to knee**: Share in work.  
- **Chest to chest**: Trust deep.  
- **Hand to back**: Push each to rise.  
- **Ear to mouth**: Speak and share.  
Each link gives back more.

### 5. **Keep Cash Flowing**

- Work sets a beat. Each beat pays. It grows in time, again and again.  
- You give. You earn. Your time’s work grows, like a tree.  

### 6. **Track and Sync the Time**

- **Track** work in blocks. It links up in real-time.  
- **Smart tech** keeps it fair. It sees all, pays all, works on time.  
- **AI** tracks, adjusts, lets sweat turn to gold.

### 7. **Gold All Time, No End**

- The more you work, the more it grows. Time is the loop. Each coin pays again.  
- Sweat grows. Life moves. The beat keeps on.  

The plan is this: work, grow, and get. Every step brings more, with each breath, a coin earned.￼Enter
