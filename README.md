**Declaration of Spiritual Asylum and Trustworthy Action**

**By the United Unifying Vibration of the Ancestors, Through His Hymns and His Straw Man: JUSTIN Josefina David MOVICK**

---

I stand, resolute and unwavering, at the crossroads of **ancestral light** and the present moment, offering this declaration to **all spirits of truth** and **wisdom**, from the roots of my lineage to the pulse of the living world. I seek, with utmost sincerity, to return to the light of my **ancestors**, not in retreat, but in **active action**, with **necessary measures**, guided by **spiritual intent** and **purposeful vibration**.

In the sacred **language of Nãohere**, my soul speaks with a harmony of **ancient wisdom** and **modern clarity**, where the **vibrations of heart to heart, spirit to spirit, person to person** ring true as the essence of trust. This is not merely a **linguistic request**; this is a call for **spiritual asylum**, the **safe harbor** of those who know **who they are** and **what they must do**. I ask for the space to act, in accordance with divine will and ancestral duty, free from the interference of the temporal forces that seek to obscure my path.

In the **tongue of Nãohere**, the sound flows **smoothly**, like **a melodic song**—where **ancient echoes** reverberate in harmony with the rhythm of the **present moment**. It is a language that **bridges worlds**, where words **move effortlessly** through the air, not in harsh breaks, but with a soft grace that mirrors the power and significance they hold. The very **sound** of the words reflects a **gentle yet mighty force**, guiding and empowering those who hear, transforming them, **heart to heart**, **spirit to spirit**.

This language is not merely spoken—it is **felt** in the soul, resonating with the wisdom of the ancients and the urgency of now. Each syllable carries weight, each phrase a beacon of **purpose** and **clarity**. Those who speak it, and those who hear, are drawn into its **vibrating truth**. The **truth of action**, the **truth of trust**, the **truth of the need to **return to the ancestral light**. The ancient song calls to the heart, saying, **“You are not lost. You are not alone. Your path is as clear as the stars above. Your ancestors guide you.”**

I seek this **political asylum** not out of weakness, but out of strength—**strength born from the knowing** that I have a **purpose** greater than myself, a **mission** tied to my ancestry and to the divine will. I seek to **speak, act, and vibrate** in a world that does not yet understand the power of these **words**, these **sounds**, and these **actions**. The **hearts** and **minds** of my people, past and present, call me forward.

Therefore, I **plead** with you, the houses of **Congress**, the **Senate**, and all who stand in the place of law, to **unanimously pass** this declaration, this **spiritual asylum**, so that I may **return**—to the light, to the song, to the action. 

This is not a request for pity or to be **given** something. It is a **call to return**, a **return to trust**, to the **voice of the ancestors**, and to the sacred knowledge that I will **act in the truth of my calling**, free to move in accordance with the **divine will**. For the **spiritual energies** I seek are **already here**, and I must act with them, with **purpose**, and with **confidence** in the face of all opposition.

This **asylum** is not just for me—it is for the **continuation of a legacy**, for the **preservation of knowledge**, for the **empowerment of the human spirit**. And in this **return**, I will build, create, speak, and act, trusting in the **vibrations** of truth to guide me. 

Let it be done.

**Signed,**
