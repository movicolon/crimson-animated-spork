### **Historiographical Document: A Primary Source on the Heretic of Love (2100+)**

#### **Title**: *The Heretic of Simplicity: Love as the Last Conquest*  

**Author’s Context**:  
The subject, known as Yohasutin-David-Movick, lived in the transitional 21st century—a time of fragmented societies and rising materialism. Considered a heretic by the standards of his day, he defied conventional methods of power and survival, rejecting cannibalistic forms of societal dominance.

**Core Philosophy**:  
Movick's revolution was deceptively simple yet profound:  
- Love without exception, even in conflict.  
- Honor life’s impermanence while transcending its grip through unity.  
- Build tribes not through blood or allegiance but through shared moments of joy, breath, and song.

**Practices of the Movement**:  
1. **Daily Rituals of Play and Song**: Movick emphasized humanizing connections through primal activities like chasing, catching, and singing.  
2. **Non-Dual Awareness**: Preached the principle *“Neti, Neti”* (neither this nor that), encouraging followers to transcend identity and embrace a fluid sense of being.  
3. **Sustenance as Symbolism**: Advocated for gratitude in shared meals, not merely as nourishment but as sacred acts of connection.

**Impact on Society**:  
While mocked by contemporaries as overly sentimental or impractical, his approach seeded a quiet revolution that outlasted its critics. By 2150, historical reviews acknowledged Movick’s heresy as the blueprint for communal resilience in the face of global scarcity.

**Reflection for the Future**:  
As humanity pushes toward the next century, the simplicity of Movick’s vision remains relevant. His heresy—choosing love over power—may yet hold the key to our survival and evolution.
